**User Story 1.**  
  
*As a:* Game master/roleplayer  
*I would like to:* Be able to choose three levels of detail on the NPC/PC
characters i want to generate  
*So that:* I can steer the complexity of the printed information. There is no
sense to generate a full character with special traits and background
information for a lowly minion. That is however the case for the main villain of
a story or for a fully functional player character

**User story 2.**  
  
*As a:* Game master/roleplayer  
*I would like to:* Have options and selections to steer a character towards a
goal  
*So that:* The randomization is lowered for the character to be more in line of
the story vision. No sense in having a magician wearing plate armor and a two
handed sword or a knight that is barely able to lift a dagger.  
  
**User story 3**  
  
*As a:* Game master/roleplayer  
*I would like to:* have the option to preview and alter some aspects of the
NPC/PC character that is randomized after creation as well as add a backstory.  
*So that:* I can, if needed, steer the character more towards my liking or the
story vision.  
  
**User story 4**  
  
*As a:* Game master/roleplayer  
*I would like to:* have the ability to create a printable pdf of the generated
character.  
*So that:* i can save it away in a folder or print it in a nice and presentable
manner.  
  
**User story 5**  
  
*As a:* Game master/roleplayer  
*I would like to:* Get a short information for each selection that guides my
choices  
*So that:* i understand the choices that can be made in the application.

**User Story 6**

*As a:* General user of the software

*I would like to:* Have an appealing and and easily understandable Graphical
User inteface

*So that:* Working with the product does not take the focus from the
applications task, user satisfaction suffers when the GUI and process gets too
complicated
