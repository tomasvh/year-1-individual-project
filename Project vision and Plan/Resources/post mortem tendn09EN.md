**Abstract**

This is a post mortem regarding the ten week long project developed using a
scrum-like process.  
The project was conducted in the end of the first year of studies on development
and operation of software systems at Linnéuniversitetet.

The developer had no previous experience in development prior to this first
year.  
And except a basic knowledge in Java and JavaFX programming the above mentioned
fact is true at the point of the start of the project as well which made this
endeavour a gigantic undertaking.

This document will provide information regarding the development, result and
reflection of the project.

**Introduction and background**

*Purpose*

The project was comically called “perhaps the worst and the best project during
your entire studies” by the head teacher. As it turns out it holds true in both
aspects.

The purpose of the project was to take the knowledge we had acquired during the
year, broaden it and create an application/website after our own ideas, with or
without outside intervention.

The technics that we had learned during the year was:

-   Java 13 – programming language

-   JavaFX 14– library for Java grafical user interfaces

The technics that had to be learned during this process was:

-   Databasteknik – more specifically MS Access and Ucanaccess library for Java

-   PDFBox – library for populating forms in a interactive pdf

-   FXML och Scenebuilder – A framework for JavaFX GUI building

-   Deployment – To create a runnable file of the project

**Goals**

The goal of the project was to create the application, in this case a non player
character maker for the roleplaying game EON, published by Helmgast, in a
professional manor including all the phases of development that we had
previously learned during our first year of study.

The project was to be planned, developed, tested and deployed in a good and
iterative way.

**Vision**

The vision of the project was to create an aid for EON gamemasters. The
developer has experience both as a player and gamemaster of this game and have
spent countless hours creating characters for the players to interact with. As
such the need for a swift way of creating these said characters seemed apparent.

A similar project was conducted by an employee of Helmgast a few years back, but
work was never finished and it also lacked the ability to produce a printable
pdf result.

**Execution of the project**

As mentioned previously an iterative way of working was conducted as well as
planning in a “scrum-like” fashion with vision and user stories.

As sprint reviews and planning is not easily done alone the developers of
different projects were put into groups to conduct these meetings.  
Every week each member of this group were supposed to present what had been done
the previous week and what was supposed to happen the following week.

**Development and technics**

In addition to the previously mentioned technics the following was researched
and used:

-   IntelliJ – IDE for Java

-   Open JDK 13 – Java JDK/SDK

-   Maven – Framework framework to organize and deploy Java project .Jar files

-   CMD and Jpackage – for deployment to .exe and .dmg files

**Positive reflections**

This project was extremely rewarding and fun to develop. To be able to actually
make something that you yourself conceived, planned, found solutions for,
developed, tested and finally deployed was a rewarding experience.

To actually create something that you yourself want to use gave it even more
drive and made the workload worthwhile, which sometimes was very useful when it
seemed like you didn´t make any progress at all.

One of the biggest advantages of this project was that I got to experience some
of the ways of development first hand in a practical rather than theoretical
way. One saw what technics were relevant and how detailed they had to be.  
This will of course change drastically when one starts to work on the same
projects along with others but for now it was very smooth.

Finally one emerge with a lot more experience and a whole lot of new technics
from the process. The creation of this application have forced me to conduct a
very steep learning curve to solve the many problems that emerged.

**Negative reflections**

Where to start?

This process was faced with a lot of hardships.  
To begin with we have the pandemic that everyone is talking about.  
For me personally it imposed two effects. Firstly sickness(not confirmed to be
covid-19, but we got sick) and secondly that we had to keep our son at home due
to the fact that we have close relations that are in the risk group. This last
bit added to a real trouble getting any peace of mind to do effective work.

Apart from this I experienced a setback when it came to deployment due to the
fact that Java and JavaFX have parted ways and as such the packaging tool that
used to be in Java is no longer there.  
This led to a witch hunt after a possible solution which finally landed on,
instead of an executable Jar, which is no longer possible with JavaFX to make an
.exe and .dmg using Maven and jpackage tool.

**Summary**

This project has, as previously mentioned been rewarding both personally and for
my studies. I don’t regret choosing this course one single bit.

I emerge stronger after this process than before it and for once I feel decently
well equipped for the coming two years of study.
