“Making life easier for EON RPG gamemasters”

Scrum product vision:

**For**: Gamemasters of EON table top RPG game

**Who**: Gamemasters who want to create NPCs for EON easier, faster and with
less effort

**The**: Eon NPC maker

**is a**: Generator of NPCs to PDF format

**That**: Applies the EON ruleset to swiftly create NPCs of three different
detail levels

**Unlike**: The Helmgast Eon PC generator(<https://helmgast.se/eongen/beta/>)
that generates a PC character in its entirety without offering a printable PDF
we aim to, by having 3 different detail levels, to produce either an entire full
size character, a specific NPC(for example a “boss” that requires more than just
the basic traits) to a very basic set of traits needed for the standard
“opponents” in a RPG session.

**Out**: A Desktop application for creating NPC characters for EON and producing
the result as a PDF.
