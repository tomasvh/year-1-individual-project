**Risks**

**Staff risks**

The time schedule for this project will pose a problem if the current world
situation with Covid-19 directly interferes with the development teamâ€™s lives.
Childcare, sickness, other projects will all potentially affect both the outcome
and schedule.

As this project is planned, developed, tested and deployed by one single
individual who also runs two other projects on the side(one job at 50% and one
additional course) as well as being a family father with a young child the
possibility of this risk to become realized would be moderate without taking the
effect of Covid-19 into the scenario. It is therefor set to high. The effect on
the project would also be nothing short of catastrophic if any or more than one
of the above mentioned scenarios would occur.

**Equipment risk**

The equipment used for this project is both fairly new and with more than enough
power to develop and deploy this project. The development team also have a
rather rigid maintenance scheme which reduces the risk even further.

Risk is set to low but with moderate effect due to backup hardware.

**Requirement and specifications change risk**

This is planned, designed and developed by one single individual, however in
this case there are potential stakeholders both in the form of the company
Helmgast that will be approached for copyright reasons and actual gamemasters
and role players on the other end. As gamemasters are interviewed for this
project more and more input is added from that direction this application will
grow and be more advanced. Helmgast might take an interest in the project as
well and give input from their side. On the other hand Helmgast might also be
helpful by providing both source code and databases from their own character
generator which might help the project.

I would set the risk of requirements and specifications to change as high, but
with moderate effect due to the potential for this to be easier rather than
harder as a result from it.

**Development team skill**

The developer in charge of this project is to be considered as very
inexperienced and with according to his own measurement, very new to both
programming in general and java as a programming language. The new technics
chosen for this project in the form of database implementation as well as
conversion to pdf might also potentially become a problem due to how steep the
learning curve is.

Course slack channel and the teachers will be there for assistance and guidance
which might reduce this risk.

Probability for the developer coding skill to interfere with the project is
therefor set to high and with serious effects to the projects wellbeing.
However, there is a safety net to counter this issue.

\| Risk \| Probability \| Effect \|  
\| ------ \| -------------- \| ------- \|  
\| Staff risk \| High \| Catastrophic \|  
\| Equipment risk \| low \| Moderate \|  
\| Requirement and specifications change risk \| High \| Moderate \|  
\| Development team skill risk \| High \| High \|
